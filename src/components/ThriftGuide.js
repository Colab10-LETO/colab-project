        <h4>Thrift Shopping Guide</h4>
        <p className="guideParagraph">
          Thrift shopping can be overwhelming, so we put together a guide to
          make your experience a little less daunting.
        </p>
        <h5>Have a plan</h5>
        <p className="guideParagraph">
          One thing that often trips people up is not having items in mind when
          going shopping. Some stores are very organized while others leave a
          lot to be desired. Creating a shopping list can turn several hours of
          mindless browsing into a quick and efficient trip.{" "}
        </p>

        <h5>Dress for the occasion</h5>
        <p className="guideParagraph">
          Thrift shopping can also be a physically demanding endeavor. Make sure
          you wear clothes that won’t restrict your movement as you dig through
          bins, reach items on the top shelf, and move around heavy items. Bonus
          points if you wear form-fitting clothing, as some thrift stores may
          not have fitting rooms. The next best thing is to be able to try on
          clothes over what you’re already wearing.
        </p>

        <h5>Check for quality</h5>
        <p className="guideParagraph">
          Not everything that gets donated is in the best condition. Make sure
          to try on everything before you commit to buying it. Some things you
          should look out for are wear and tear along the seams, at the collar,
          and at the sleeves. You should also look out for stains around the
          neck, armpits, and inner thigh.
        </p>

        <h5>Consider the location</h5>
        <p className="guideParagraph">
          The kind of items thrift stores sell depends on what donations they
          receive from the surrounding residential areas. If you’re looking for
          the latest design clothes, you may want to check out stores near
          college campuses or more affluent neighborhoods. If you are looking
          for maternity or baby clothes, check out stores near public schools or
          suburban neighborhoods.
        </p>

        <h5>The employees are your friends</h5>
        <p className="guideParagraph">
          Thrift shopping is a far from perfect experience, but store employees
          are a great resource for when you can’t find what you’re looking for.
          They can tell you what day they restock the stores with fresh
          merchandise, what stores may have the items you desire, or where
          certain items are located throughout the store.{" "}
