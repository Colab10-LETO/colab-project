Summary 
What is it? :
The state of thrift shopping and clothing donations is very unorganized, and it can be overwhelming to the unseasoned shopper. A platform to make sustainable clothing shopping more accessible by allowing older, less tech savvy users easily find centers to donate, buy, or recycle second-hand textiles. 
Problem Background 
Who is the customer and what is the need or problem we’re addressing? Why should we address this problem now? What are all of the things we know? How do we know this is a problem? 
 
Fast fashion has an enormous environmental impact on our planet. According to The Environmental Protection Agency, fast fashion is responsible for 10% of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions and 20% of global wastewater. Clothing manufacturing uses more energy than the aviation and shipping sectors combined. According to the American Chemical Society, to provide wool pulp used in manufacturing certain fabrics, 770 million tons of trees are felled each year, and it is projected that the figure could double by the year 2034, as there is an expectation that fashion production could triple by the year 2050.
According to a MacArthur Foundation Study, the fashion industry produces 1.2 million metric tons of CO2 each year. Among the impacts are massive water consumption, which accounts for up to 20% of global industrial water pollution, and microplastic pollution, which harms some marine life.
There is the social impact that stems from fast fashion’s need to be cheap, hence a dependency on an exploited labor force, and child labor in developing countries where regulations are lax.
Fashion can be more sustainable and beneficial to the environment through circular fashion.
Circular fashion according to Anna Brismar, is defined as clothes, shoes, or accessories that are designed, sourced, produced, and provided to be used and circulated responsibly and effectively in society for as long as possible in their most valuable form, and thereafter returned safely to the biosphere when no longer of human use.
Identifying circular fashion brands can be very tricky. Unless you know your options, the idea of finding, and buying used clothing pieces might feel daunting.
How can we help consumers of circular fashion brands identify, and have access to multiple options when making purchases? How can we help customers have access to a platform where they can easily donate used fabrics in good condition? How can we help customers have access to recycling fabrics not in a condition good enough for reuse? How do we contribute to lessening the damaging impacts of mass production, consumerism, improper disposal of old fabrics?
 
Goals 
Talk about the general high-level goals of doing this work. What are we trying to accomplish by solving the problem? 
·       Build a solution that will link users with brands that promote circular fashion.
·       Provide a solution that will help customers properly dispose of fabrics
·       Contribute to reducing the impact of fast fashion (mass production of clothing) on the environment.
·       Educate more customers on the need to protect the environment
User Stories 
Put 3-5 user stories here. Keep it high level. As a <type of user>, I want to <goal to be accomplished>, so that <reason for the goal>. 
·       As a circular fashion enthusiast, I want a solution that gives me access to shops that sell used clothes
·       I want a solution that will make it easy for access buyers of very good used clothes
·       As an environmental enthusiast, I want a solution that will make it easy for me to recycle textiles in a proper manner which would in turn protect the environment.
Proposed Solution 
What are you proposing is the solution to the problem being tackled? Keep this to a few sentences, again focusing on the WHAT, not the HOW.
Problem Statement: How can we help consumers of circular fashion brands identify, and have access to multiple options when making purchases? How can we help customers have access to a platform where they can easily donate used fabrics in good condition? How can we help customers have access to recycling fabrics not in a condition good enough for reuse? How do we contribute to lessening the damaging impacts of mass production, consumerism, improper disposal of old fabrics?
Solution: A possible solution will be developing a tool that would act as a one-stop-shop in addressing the questions in the problem statement. The solution will act as a directory linking customers/users to a variety of providers offering these services. It will also act as a platform for service providers to link directly with potential customers needing their services.
 
 
 
Scenarios 
What are your key scenarios (based off your user stories)? What is the definition of done (or acceptance criterion) for each of them? Note: This should be finalized as a team.

Measuring Success 
Co.Lab Success Metrics 
What would you consider success to look like by Demo Day for your team? What would be the definition of done for your product by that point? Note: This should be finalized as a team. 
 
The team would consider demo day a success if we are able to deliver our MVP. Our MVP is integrating user functions (Buy, Donate and Recycle) in our application. Some metrics to measure could be location data (how many users actually visit the stores) and conversion rates (how many clicks the “get directions” button gets).
Product Success Metrics 
Consider metrics you’d want to measure to consider the product a success. How would we know if we’ve solved the problem? What are the things we’d want to measure? 
Milestones & Timeline 
What are the milestones and project stages within Co.Lab? How will you consider your roll-out plan? What about extending beyond?
